Hello, world ðŸ‘‹!

This is the beginning of hopefully successful thing I call "Project Abundance".

After [writing initial set of constraints] and thinking about it for quite a while, it is finally time to dedicate all
my time to it and see where it leads us.

During last couple of weeks [new repository](https://github.com/nazar-pc/abundance) was created with some initial CI
infrastructure for building this website, a book and Rust docs of the code.

A [book] was started that tries to provide some details about the project and will accumulate many technical details
over time.

[Smart contracts initial dump] was merged, which contains some infrastructure for building smart contracts that would
run in (currently) imaginary execution environment. It is just an early prototype, but should give an idea of what
things might look and feel.

I have learned way too much about working writing Rust for `const` environment, about procedural macros and various
static site generators.

Next I'll be thinking about how to add a notion of capabilities to smart contracts (imagine allowing to withdraw certain
amount of certain token only) and documenting the architecture of execution environment with diagrams.
