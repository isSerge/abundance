      <title>Blockchain as a library</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most blockchain implementations are pieces of software that include the logic to support many different roles/features,
possibly all at once: bootstrap node, block producer, RPC node, archival node, light client, etc. That is one way to do
it, but one thing I learned over the years is that you can do a lot of interesting optimizations if you can apply
additional constraints during the design phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why is basically everyone trying to combine all into one? Let&amp;rsquo;s consider different roles separately first and see
what is special or interesting about them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The beginning of a Spec</title>
      <link>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-04-21-the-beginning-of-a-spec/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past weeks, my updates have highlighted many of the ideas emerging from our open design
discussions. Now that we have a clearer direction for the design, I wanted to consolidate these
ideas into a draft spec. This will serve as a foundation for implementing the first few prototypes,
while also providing a structured way to gather feedback and uncover potential blind spots. I expect
this spec to suffer significant changes, but it felt like the perfect way to consolidate the ideas,
get feedback from the community, and unblock Nazar in case he wants to start prototyping some of the
ideas we&amp;rsquo;ve been discussing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last time I mentioned that I was looking into Merkle Trees to replace KZG. This week it happened, the whole codebase is
basically free from KZG. The only place that is not fully fixed and where I am looking for help is &lt;a href=&#34;https://abundance.build/book/Contribute.html#gpu-plotting&#34;&gt;GPU plotting&lt;/a&gt;, it
broke with all these changes and isn&amp;rsquo;t the highest priority for me to fix right now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The data availability problem</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week has been another good week of progress. I finally have a good idea of how shard archiving
should work in the happy path, and I&amp;rsquo;ve started writing a low-level spec for it (that I am hoping to
push to this repo soon). Unfortunately, there is still a slight gap in the spec that we need to fill
before we can move forward: the &lt;em&gt;data availability problem&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week was lighter on code changes and more heavy on research. Specifically, I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking into commitment
schemes generally and Blake3 hash function in particular, which was already used in the codebase, but turns out can be
applied in more interesting ways than just a hash function.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../2025-01-13-welcome&#34;&gt;Welcome&lt;/a&gt; post mentioned briefly &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/nazar-pc/760505c5ad7d56c20b2c75c1484e672f&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;initial set of constraints&lt;/a&gt; that led to the creation of this project, but I figured it
might be helpful to have a short writeup about it that might be helpful for sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short: we&amp;rsquo;re building a blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rdquo; I really mean just me and Alfonso so far, but I hope more people will join over time if they find it
interesting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Merged Farming</title>
      <link>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-04-07-merged-farming/</link>

      <guid>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-04-07-merged-farming/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I&amp;rsquo;ve gone a bit deeper into the design of the multi-shard Subspace protocol idea which I briefly introduced in my last update. The protocol is conformed by the following parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharded archiving, responsible for creating a global canonical history of the whole system, and of creating the history records that will eventually become part of farmers&amp;rsquo; plots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharded plotting, which takes records from the global history and seals them in plots that include segments of the history of every shard of the system, and that will be used for the farming process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And finally, merged farming, which is the protocol responsible for challenging farmer plots, and deriving the corresponding winning tickets that elect block proposers in specific shards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me introduce the high-level operation behind each of these sub-protocols, while digging deep in the one that I&amp;rsquo;ve focused the most on this week: sharded archiving.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The majority of last week I spent tinkering with Subspace codebase after importing it here in preparation for building
an actual blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The majority of the last two weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy with the installation of the antivirus system update for my immune
system. It was neither pleasant nor quick, but now that it is slowly approaching 100%, I&amp;rsquo;m back with another update of
what I managed to do since the last update.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Multi-shard Subspace Protocol</title>
      <link>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-03-31-multi-shard-subspace-protocol/</link>

      <guid>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-03-31-multi-shard-subspace-protocol/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a lot of thinking, this week I came to the realisation that a sharded architecture like the one we are trying to build can be designed leveraging the current design of the Subspace protocol and all its underlying mechanisms as a base. While this was the idea from the beginning, either for lack of familiarity with the protocol or plain ignorance, I was missing the big picture of how this could be done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Thinking formally in terms of sidechains</title>
      <link>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-03-24-thinking-formally-in-terms-of-sidechains/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Overall, I am really happy with the progress I&amp;rsquo;ve made this week. I&amp;rsquo;ve been mainly focused on unravelling one of the
papers that I mentioned in my last update, &lt;a href=&#34;https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1239.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Proof-of-Stake Sidechains&lt;/a&gt;. While is
true that we don&amp;rsquo;t want our system to have anything to do with PoS, and there is no 1:1 matching of the concepts from
the paper with what we are trying to build, the paper presents a framework that can come pretty handy to evaluate the
correctness of our designs. This paper is from 2018, and after a first pass the first thing that I did is to check if
there were any follow-up papers that built upon the abstractions of this paper. I came
across &lt;a href=&#34;https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1048.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Proof-of-Work Sidechains&lt;/a&gt; from the same authors, but without a doubt, the
most complete proposal is the one that I started with. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive right into it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Way faster transactions and no-panic</title>
      <link>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-03-17-way-faster-transactions-and-no-panic/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://abundance.build/blog/2025-03-17-way-faster-transactions-and-no-panic/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The plan was to get to transaction pool implementation, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t quite happen. I did a lot of investigation around
performance though. For example, transaction processing was several orders of magnitude slower than direct method calls
without a transaction, which concerned me, but after optimizations of last week the difference is ~10x. And it makes
sense given how much more work the wallet has to do on top of the method call itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to kick-off my first weekly update in the project thanking Nazar for the warm welcome and the opportunity to work with him on this exciting project. I was really pumped to see other teams actively working on a similar problem to the one I started researching more than three years ago. For several reasons, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t actively contributing to this problem any more, but this opportunity was the perfect excuse to get back to the game.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The big change from the last update is that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/adlrocha/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Alfonso de la Rocha&lt;/a&gt; has joined me
as a part-time researcher to help with sharding designing. Code-wise, there were also a bunch of performance benchmarks
and optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The most important progress from last week is initial work on transactions. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent quite some time thinking about
the design and even implemented an initial wallet contract alongside with related infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was a challenging week working on storage access checks for slots, but it is over, and I&amp;rsquo;m quite happy with how
things are looking right now. Some extra refactoring also allowed running tests under Miri and spotted some things that
violate the Rust safety rules.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week felt a bit less productive with a lot of time spent thinking about how to approach slots conflict resolution
in the native execution environment, but still managed to land a few improvements, especially on the documentation side.
Also conducted four separate interviews.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week was busy with refactoring with the primary goal of being able to run contracts in test execution environment.
The environment is not quite ready yet, but a lot of progress was done, and it&amp;rsquo;ll hopefully be ready next week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, world 👋!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the beginning of hopefully successful thing I call &amp;ldquo;Project Abundance&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/nazar-pc/760505c5ad7d56c20b2c75c1484e672f&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;writing initial set of constraints&lt;/a&gt; and thinking about it for quite a while, it is finally time to dedicate all
my time to it and see where it leads us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
